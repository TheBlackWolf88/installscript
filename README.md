So yes. This is just a regular Arch Linux installer script, that installs the base system, network utilities and enough xorg to get dwm running. Probably not perfect and it might have some issues. I hope someone finds it useful!
To get it working on the iso you'll need to install the 'git' package. To do that you must run "pacman -Sy && pacman -S git".
